# yii-app

This is a docker  project using yii framework, which I have created by refering the below websites.

# https://codemix.com/projects/yii2-dockerized/

# Clone the below respository
git clone https://github.com/codemix/yii2-dockerized.git myproject

# Change the directory into the project folder, inside there will be a build folder navigate to the same.

This directory mainly contains the composer.json file along with the docker-compose.yml file for running the composer

# Once you are in the build folder run the below command.

# docker-compose run --rm composer update

The above command will run an composer container using the docker-compose file in the same folder and execute the update command.
